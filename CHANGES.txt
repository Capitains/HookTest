## 1.1.3 - 2017-07-14

- Updated the epidoc.rng file to the latest one
- Added more detailed output about DTD errors to the table output

## 1.1.2 - 2017-06-23

Added '.' output during extracting txt files during build to keep Travis from timing out.

## 1.1.1 - 2017-06-14

- Corrected bug where a work level URN on the ti:work node in the metadata files would cause hooktest to crash (Issue #98)
- Corrected bug where testing the current directory, i.e., path == ".", would cause hooktest to crach (Issue #97)

## 1.1.0 - 2017-06-06

Added the --txt parameter to the build class to allow all passing XML files to be converted to plain text and included
in the build.
In addition, added the --cites parameter (also to the build class). When this parameter is true, the citation unit of
each textual node in the plain text file will be introduced with a string representing the citation unit, e.g., 1.1.1

## 1.0.3 - 2017-05-12

Made the creation of the tar archive on build an option with the --tar flag.

## 1.0.2 - 2017-05-04

Added the new "commentary" type to the tests for language and URNs

## 1.0.0 - 2017-04-21

- Simplified some code for logs
- Reworked CLI (Console, travis, verbose, from_travis_to_hook were reworked into console, manifest, verbose, hookui)
- Moved CTS units to HookTest.capitains_units.cts and renamed them for clarity
- When some tests breaks, it stops others in HookTest.capitains_units.cts.CTSText_TestUnit.run
- Added a timeout parameter to allow for breaking out of network issues with RelaxNG Scheme checking
